## AI Actors

The application features 5 AI actors in a structured discussion:

- ü§î **Questioner**: Asks insightful questions about the topic
- üë®‚Äçüî¨ **Expert 1**: Provides detailed answers
- üë©‚Äçüî¨ **Expert 2**: Enhances or optimizes Expert 1's answers
- ‚úÖ **Validator**: Validates questions and answers for relevance and accuracy
- üë®‚Äçüíº **Moderator**: Manages the conversation flow and decides who speaks next

## Features

- Multiple UI options (Gradio web interface and console)
- Real-time discussion updates
- Clear role identification for each participant
- Structured conversation flow managed by the Moderator
- Automatic topic exploration through multiple perspectives
- Maximum 20 rounds of discussion

## Architecture

The application is designed with a clean separation of concerns:

- **AIDiscussion**: Core class handling the AI actors and discussion logic
- **GradioUI**: Web interface implementation using Gradio
- **ConsoleUI**: Simple terminal-based interface

The AIDiscussion class can be easily integrated with other UI implementations by using its callback mechanism:

```python
def your_callback(actor: str, message: str):
    # Handle the message in your UI
    pass

discussion = AIDiscussion()
discussion.start_discussion("your topic", callback=your_callback)
